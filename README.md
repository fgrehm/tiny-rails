# TinyRails

Scaffold for tiny Rails apps based on JosÃ© Valim's Rails Lightweight Stack
[code](https://gist.github.com/1942658)


## Installation

Install it using:

    $ gem install tiny-rails


## WTF?! Why would I use this?

Although the generated application code could be used on a production server,
the idea is to try to give you a really basic application to try out new Rails
gems, create spikes and to provide an isolated small Rails environment for
reproducing bugs to support bug reports.

You could also use this to create a single page application with all rails
features like code reloading and the asset pipeline without having to set up
a Sinatra application from the ground app.


## Usage

```terminal
$ tiny-rails new tiny-app
      create
      create  .gitignore
      create  Gemfile
      create  boot.rb
      create  tiny_rails_controller.rb
      create  index.html.erb
      create  server
      create  config.ru
       chmod  server
```

This will give you a pretty basic application that you can run with `rackup`
or you prefferend server. It even supports code reloading for the generated
controller!


## Addons

You can provide the `-a` parameter when creating new apllications to enable a
list of "addons" on the generated app. For example:

```terminal
$ tiny-rails new tiny-app -a activerecord
         ...
       apply  /path/to/tiny-rails/gem/addons/activerecord.rb
     gemfile    activerecord (~> 3.2)
     gemfile    sqlite3
      create    models.rb
      insert    tiny_rails_controller.rb
      insert    boot.rb
      create    migrate
       chmod    migrate
      append    .gitignore
```

Or you can run `tiny-rails add [list of addons]` from a generated application
folder.

Here's a list of the addons bundled with the gem:

* [activerecord](https://github.com/fgrehm/tiny-rails/blob/master/addons/activerecord.rb)
* [coffeescript](https://github.com/fgrehm/tiny-rails/blob/master/addons/coffeescript.rb)
* [jquery](https://github.com/fgrehm/tiny-rails/blob/master/addons/jquery.rb)
* [client_side_validations](https://github.com/fgrehm/tiny-rails/blob/master/addons/client_side_validations.rb)


### Building your own addon

The API for writing addon scripts are based on Rails'
[application templates](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html)
(with a smaller API), please have a look at the [bundled addons](https://github.com/fgrehm/tiny-rails/blob/master/addons/),
[`TinyRails::Actions`](https://github.com/fgrehm/tiny-rails/blob/master/lib/tiny-rails/actions.rb)
and [`Thor::Actions`](http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions.html)
modules to find out whats supported.

As with Rails' application templates, you can use remote addon scripts, just pass
in the URL as an argument to `tiny-rails new` or `tiny-rails add`.
